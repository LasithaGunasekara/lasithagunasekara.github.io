## Highlighted Projects

- **Project 1 — Near-Singular Integration (Course Project, Spring 2025)**  
  *Team: Lasitha Gunasekara, Sanjida Yeasmin, Jonathan Engle · Advisor: Dr. Bryan Quaife*  
  Survey and analysis of methods for evaluating near-singular integrals (QBX, extrapolated regularization, geometric methods, three-region approaches). Includes theoretical insights and numerical comparisons.

- **Project 2 — Modeling and Analysis of Spin Coating (Advanced Transport Phenomena, Fall 2024)**  
  Derived/validated thin-film equations under lubrication assumptions; reproduced Bornside et al. dry-film thickness results and discussed model limitations.

- **Project 3 — Truncated SVD (tSVD) and Applications (Graduate Seminar, Spring 2024)**  
  Overview of SVD vs. tSVD, dimensionality reduction, noise filtering, and conditioning of linear systems (connections to Chebyshev/Levin-type quadrature).

- **Poster — Capsule in Shear Flow (NJIT Poster)**  
  Role of shear on an **active nematic** viscous drop using spectral BIE methods; step toward simulating suspensions in confinement.
